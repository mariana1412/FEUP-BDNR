# Project

## Data

Data should be stored in a `data` folder in the root of the repository. Raven will access this folder for data. If starting fresh, docker will automatically create this folder.

## Run raven

Run docker-compose from the `ravendb` folder to start raven:

```
cd ravendb && docker-compose up
```

Open http://localhost:8080/ to access the Raven Studio.
